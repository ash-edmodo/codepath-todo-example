# Codepath ToDo Prerequisite Example Android App
Prerequisite example Android project for Codepath. 

This is my implementation of a ToDo application outlined here [Codepath ToDo Prerequisite Example App] (http://courses.codepath.com/snippets/intro_to_android/prework#heading-5-extending-your-todo)

Time spent: 3.5 hours to date.

Completed user stories:

* [x] Can you successfully add and remove items from the todo list within your app?
* [x] Did you include support for editing todo items as described above?
* [x] Does your app persist todo items and retrieve them properly on app restart?
* [x] Did you successfully push your code to github? Can you see the code on github?
* [x] Did you add a README which includes a GIF walkthrough of the app's functionality?

Note:
-----
This took slightly longer to complete that I think it should have as I totally missed the note about the third-party library needed for file-IO in the slides & wasted time looking it up.

Also I think I would add a second step in the deletion interaction, where by a small button's displayed on the list-view items which invokes the actual deletion method.
